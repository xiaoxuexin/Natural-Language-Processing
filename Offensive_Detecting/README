The School of Information’s mission is literally “We create and share knowledge so that people will use information – with technology – to build a better world.” One major impediment to people’s use of technology today is uncivil behavior online. Hate speech, bullying, toxic language, and other forms of harassment all affect people’s ability to access information and engage in social activities. In this homework, you’ll be tackling this problem head-on by building an insult detector! Help mitigate people attacking one another by flagging these kinds of conflicts for administrators. Your task will be to build two classifiers that label text as either a personal insult or a regular communication. The fate of free discourse rests on your shoulders.

Given the toxic nature of people’s comments, please be aware that you may see messages that are deeply offensive and an affront to all that is right and good. Neither the instructor nor the community at SI agrees with or supports these viewpoints. Their inclusion in the homework is entirely for the purposes of development new NLP technologies that help administrators and moderators identify and remove these messages from otherwise civil discourse. As such, it would be difficult to develop an insult classifier without actually seeing what they look like.
