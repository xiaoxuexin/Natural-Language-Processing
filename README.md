# Natural-Language-Processing
SI 630 Natural Language Processing: Algorithms and People

Syllabus Winter 2019

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the study of the computational treatment of natural language--the words we use everyday. NLP draws on research in Linguistics, Theoretical Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics, Psychology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, with broad applications to many other fields. This course introduces students to a variety of NLP methods available for reasoning about text in computational systems. We will focus on major algorithms used in NLP for various applications (e.g., part-of-speech tagging, parsing, machine translation), on the linguistic phenomena those algorithms attempt to model, and on the people who interpret and utter the language. Students will implement a variety of algorithms for different linguistic aspects (e.g., syntax, semantics) and also understand the creation of ground truth data through linguistically annotating data on which those algorithms depend.
Broadly speaking, the course has six major parts which are interleaved through most discussions:

1. Linguistic, mathematical, and computational background
2. Computational models of morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse, pragmatics
3. Core NLP technology: parsing, part of speech tagging, text generation, semantic
analysis, etc.
4. Applications: text classification, sentiment analysis, text summarization, questionanswering, machine translation, information extraction, etc.
5. Human Factors in language understanding and generation, including sociolinguistics and
data annotation
6. Neural Networks and Deep Learning: autoencoders, recurrent NNs, LSTM, etc.
